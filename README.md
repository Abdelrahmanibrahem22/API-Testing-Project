# API-Testing-Project
Project Introduction:

This project requires you to test Trello's REST APIs using Postman.

Trello is a team management web application where teams can collaborate, manage projects, and reach new productivity peaks.

You will test board creating, deleting, creating lists within a board, getting lists in a board, archiving, and un-archiving lists.

You are required to automate all the test cases and generate a testing report w/ the status of features using each test case/scenario status (PASS/FAIL), the execution time of the automated test, and the testing steps status (PASS/FAIL)
